This was part of our first milestone project in the Udemy course I'm doing (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp). Our task was:
  Create a Tic Tac Toe game. Here are the requirements:
    - 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
    - The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
    - You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board

It took a few hours, but I was eventually able to pull together this lovely piece of code to achieve what I needed. This project was quite the experience, especially whenever I'd come across those random coding errors/inconsistencies.
